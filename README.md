# Yugioh-For-HoloLens
The popular card game Yugioh, now a reality! With this game, you'll be able to experience holographic duels just like on the TV show.

Let's try to keep this game on the most up to date version of the Unity HTP. That way contributers that join later on won't have to worry about looking for old versions of the Unity HTP for development. Since YuGiOh is a huge game, for the sake of time, I ask that any contributer try to keep the game inline with these current scope and goals: 

1. Early Yugioh rules (Yugi and Kaiba SDK era)
2. Original Yugi and Kaiba Starter Decks ONLY (for now)
3. Local multiplayer first (online once local works)

Additionally, these are the current project goals that need to be fulfilled in order of priority: 

1. Basic card functions (summon, set, activate)
2. Add cards from Yugi and Kaiba Starter Decks (needs card images and 3D models)
3. Add turn-based system (turn phases like draw and main phase)
4. Basic gameplay functions
5. Multiplayer
6. Sounds and Animations
7. Optimization

If you're not a programmer but can do 3D modelling, animations, or sound effects, email me to submit your work. My email is generalheed@rocketmail.com

Thanks for the help everyone and let's make everyone's childhood dreams come true!
